IT IS BACK!!!\n","![System image](https://storage.googleapis.com/aibootcamp/general_assets/ml_system_architecture.png)\n","\n","\n","This week is all about system building. Because hardly ever does a ML system stand alone. Your success in building a system for Ortec Finance depends as much on what is around your neural net as it depends on the neural net itself. This baseline is my approach to the problem. Much in this notebook was hacked together so I am sure you can improve on many points. Perhaps you even come up with a completely different approach.\n","\n","## The approach, character wise classification:\n","The goal of the task is to extract information from the invoice. The invoice has been run through optical character recognition (OCR). OCR turns PDFs into texts but often messes up the order and confuses come characters. **To extract information from this text, we classify each character by category**. \n","\n","Take an example, if we just wanted to get the amount we would classify the characters like this:\n","\n","|T|O|T|A|L|:| |€| |4|3|6|.|0|0|\n","|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n","|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|\n","\n","We classify our text into 6 classes here:\n","\n","Ignore:           0\n","Sender Name:      1 \n","Sender KVK:       2 \n","Sender IBAN:      3 \n","Invoice Reference:4\n","Total:            5\n","\n","These are the classes that the training data generator tags. But the class of a character does not only depend on the character. It depends on its surroundings as well. To train our model, we create substrings of our invoice that include a certain amount of preceeding and succeeding characters. The amount of preceding and succeeding characters is defined in the `PADDING` global variable. \n","\n","If for example we wanted to classify the character '€' from the example above and had `PADDING = 3` we would feed\n","'L: € 43' into our network. You can see how the amount of padding has a great influence on the performance of our system.\n","\n","## Post processing:\n","A significant part of model performance stems from what is done with the outputs of the neural net. This approach groups predictions to prediction sequences and only keeps predictions in which 5 consecutive characters were grouped into the same category. An approach to try would be to allow sequences to be interrupted by one character. Another nice add on would be to rank predicted sequences by the total confidence the neural network has in the sequence. \n","\n","## Some tips:\n","For this assignment you can dive pretty deep into software development. \n","You might find these jupyter tricks helpful: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/\n","\n","Especially debugging with `pdb` really makes things easier: https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands\n","\n","Basically, if anything crashes, you can start a new cell and enter `%debug`. You then come to a command line in which you can look around what happened at the crash.\n","The debugger has some special commands. For example `p my_var` prints out a variable. This also works for other python operations, e.g. `p len(my_list)`.\n","\n","Good luck with building a great system!"]},{"metadata":{"id":"vPwoeWxK6D15","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"J_mZzOVTJT6D","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0},"output_extras":[{"item_id":2}],"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":219},"outputId":"ea9992be-fd1c-4035-bd81-4a792c1837b5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1521101941642,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1520,"user":{"displayName":"rik","photoUrl":"//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZGIi-vN4KMU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFk/Ki-nNio6VVM/s50-c-k-no/photo.jpg","userId":"113719912521762461555"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# Setup \n","!wget -nc https://storage.googleapis.com/aibootcamp/data/ortec_templates.zip"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["--2018-03-15 08:19:01--  https://storage.googleapis.com/aibootcamp/data/ortec_templates.zip\r\n","Resolving storage.googleapis.com (storage.googleapis.com)... 74.125.28.128, 2607:f8b0:400e:c04::80\r\n","Connecting to storage.googleapis.com (storage.googleapis.com)|74.125.28.128|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 20347 (20K) [application/zip]\n","Saving to: ‘ortec_templates.zip’\n","\n","ortec_templates.zip 100%[===================>]  19.87K  --.-KB/s    in 0s      \n","\n","2018-03-15 08:19:01 (42.8 MB/s) - ‘ortec_templates.zip’ saved [20347/20347]\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"qXnlL2boJjII","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["#  !unzip - ortec_templates.zip"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"_DnStomIJjRk","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0},"output_extras":[{"item_id":1}],"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54},"outputId":"fdad2f50-c4af-4bf1-c124-50f1f702f204","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1521101962838,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1268,"user":{"displayName":"rik","photoUrl":"//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZGIi-vN4KMU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFk/Ki-nNio6VVM/s50-c-k-no/photo.jpg","userId":"113719912521762461555"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["!ls"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["datalab  __MACOSX  ortec_templates.zip\ttemplates\r\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"vOyKxSEhdcy4","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0},"output_extras":[{"item_id":1}],"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":2083},"outputId":"23dcfb69-2679-4c22-ca33-5a50519a9674","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1521101970669,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1271,"user":{"displayName":"rik","photoUrl":"//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZGIi-vN4KMU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFk/Ki-nNio6VVM/s50-c-k-no/photo.jpg","userId":"113719912521762461555"}}},"cell_type":"code","source":[" !cat templates/TEMPLATE_1.txt"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["f-torec%\r\n","Aan:\r\n","\r\n","<SENDER_NAME>\r\n","<SENDER_STREET>\r\n","<SENDER_POST> <SENDER_CITY>\r\n","\r\n","<RECIPIENT_NAME>\r\n","<RECIPIENT_STREET>\r\n","KvK nr:\r\n","\r\n","<RECIPIENT_POST> <RECIPIENT_CITY>\r\n","\r\n","BTW nr:\r\n","\r\n","Bank:\r\n","BAN:\r\n","BIC:\r\n","Tel:\r\n","E-mail:\r\n","Website:\r\n","\r\n","Factuur\r\n","\r\n","<KVKNR>\r\n","<VATNR>\r\n","<BANK_NAME>\r\n","<IBAN>\r\n","<BIC_CODE>\r\n","<PHONE>\r\n","<EMAIL>\r\n","<WEBSITE>\r\n","\r\n","Factuurnummer\r\n","\r\n","Factuurdatum\r\n","\r\n","Uw referentie\r\n","\r\n","<INVOICE_NR>\r\n","\r\n","<INVOICE_DATE>\r\n","\r\n","<CUSTOMER_REFERENCE>\r\n","\r\n","DATUM\r\n","\r\n","AANTAL\r\n","\r\n","PRIJS\r\n","\r\n","BTW\r\n","\r\n","SUBTOTAAL\r\n","\r\n","OMSCHRIJVING\r\n","\r\n","<ITEM_1_NAME>\r\n","\r\n","<ITEM_1_QUANT>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_1_PRICE>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_1_VAT>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_1_TOTAL>\r\n","\r\n","\r\n","<ITEM_2_NAME>\r\n","\r\n","<ITEM_2_QUANT>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_2_PRICE>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_2_VAT>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_2_TOTAL>\r\n","\r\n","\r\n","<ITEM_3_NAME>\r\n","\r\n","<ITEM_3_QUANT>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_3_PRICE>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_3_VAT>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_3_TOTAL>\r\n","\r\n","\r\n","<ITEM_4_NAME>\r\n","\r\n","<ITEM_4_QUANT>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_4_PRICE>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_4_VAT>\r\n","\r\n","€ <ITEM_4_TOTAL>\r\n","\r\n","TOTAAL EXCL.
